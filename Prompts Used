GeoMind AI

AI-Powered CAD Geometry Analyzer

Overview

GeoMind AI is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes CAD files (STEP and STL) and generates intelligent, structured insights using AI. It bridges raw geometry data with practical design and manufacturing understanding through automated analysis and explanation.

Key Capabilities

CAD File Support: STEP (.step/.stp) and STL (.stl)

Geometry Analysis:

STL: Triangle count and bounding box dimensions

STEP: Face and edge counts using B-Rep analysis (with intelligent fallbacks)

3D Visualization: Interactive preview for STL files

AI Insights: Context-aware explanations powered by Hugging Face Inference API

Clean UI: Insight cards, tabs, and educational expanders for clarity

Engineering Highlights (In Short)

Product Thinking:
Clear scope decisions to maximize value and stability (e.g., STL-only 3D preview due to STEP complexity).

Engineering Judgment:
Robust fallback strategies for CAD parsing libraries to handle platform and dependency limitations.

AI Competence:
Structured, context-aware prompting that adapts AI responses based on file type and extracted geometry metrics.

UX Focus:
Insight cards, educational sections, and a clean layout designed for quick understanding by both technical and non-technical users.

Delivery:
Iterative refinement from POC to a stable, demo-ready application with graceful error handling.
